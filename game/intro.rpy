    mc "(It hasn't been so dark yet so early in a while. I'll need to start carrying my winter clothes with me now.)"
    mc "(Suddenly, the rumbling of a car's engine knocks me out of my trance.)"
    mc "(I should head home now.)"
    mc "(A small, but brightly colored bar interrupts my calm walk home. Its neon colors flash throughout the street, making me feel nostalgic.)"
    mc "(I miss the days of neon lighting and cheery nightlife. Something about the cool colors and rounded shapes and signs reminds me of a simpler time.)"
    mc "(As I swing my grocery bag around needlessly, a small group of people burst out of the bar, laughing and shouting and all.)"
    mc "(So much for my calm walk back. I'd rather not be around random drunks, so I'll hurry up.)"
    mc "(They also start walking, heading in the same direction as I am.)"

    mc "(I know that someone hit me with a brick, but apparently I stumbled onto the street as well, just as a car drove by.)"
    mc "(The doctors told me it was permanent. Something about severe brain trauma, and how it was a miracle I can still live now.)"
    mc "(Oddly enough, I don't really feel sad or angry about it. I don't really feel anything right now. I mean, am I supposed to feel something? I just lost everything, right? Surely I should feel something, right?)"
    mc "(But nothing comes to me. I don't know how I should react. I don't know what the old me would have done. I can only stay silent, waiting for something to happen.)"
    mc "('A miracle I can still live', huh. I certainly don't feel alive right now. I don't have the emotions that a normal person would have. Emotionally speaking, I'm on the same level as a corpse.)"

    mc "(It takes some time for me to recover. My body isn't as badly injured as it appeared to be, but it still took some time. About two months, actually."
    mc "Soon enough I'll be able to walk again, and after that I could go back to how I used to be, minus the memories. I tried my best to feel something in my heart."
    mc "Books that would inspire even the most hopeless of individuals would only make me more willing to turn around in bed. Movies that would turn stoics into sobbing messes can force less tears out of my eyes than a yawn.)"
    mc "(But at least I'm willing to feel something.)"
    with fade
    mc "(A few weeks after that, the doctors allowed me to walk. I could get up and move around the room and the halls, as long as an attendant was with me.)"
    mc "(I barely moved from my bed at all. I didn't see a need, since I didn't have anything to do once I stood up. If I needed to use a bathroom, it only took a few seconds to get there. I didn't need to walk around for a few minutes.)"
    mc "(Something strange happened after this checkpoint in my recovery. My back started tingling, my legs started getting sore. But most importantly of all, my head started to ache."
    mc "It was like my brain had expanded 3 sizes, but my skull didn't catch up. I felt an odd pressure against the front and back of my head.)"
    mc "(No matter what I tried, I couldn't get it to stop. It was such a minor pain that I didn't want to bother the doctors, but it was getting so bad that I couldn't stand it anymore.)"
    mc "(I'll just call the nurse.)"
    mc "(I press the red button on my nightstand. A dull electric buzz sounds throughout the room.)"
    mc "(The nurse hasn't come yet. I don't know how long I've been waiting, but it seems like an eternity. I press the button again.)"
    mc "(It's stuck. The button is stuck in the pressed state, and even though it goes down slightly when I press it, I don't hear a buzz.)"
    mc "(...)"
    mc "(Is there any way I can call the nurse from here?)"
    mc "(I look around the room, trying to find something that can help. But I don't see anything.)"
    mc "(Looks like I'll have to get up. I don't want to do that.)"
    mc "(I get up from my lying position and sit up on the bed. A huge wave of dizziness washes through my head and I almost fall back down.)"
    mc "(I can't tell if I'm moving or not, but I manage to keep my ground and wait for the dizziness to settle.)"
    mc "(I try to twist over to the side of the bed, but I don't know if it's the muscle loss from the coma or simply my body refusing, but I can't move. My elbows lock up and my muscles start twitching rapidly.)"
    mc "(Do I really need to get up? Surely I can just wait for the routine check-in that the nurse does?)"
    mc "(I begin to relax my body. I start to pull the covers back over my body. Their warmth comforts me, yearning for my return.)" 
    mc "(It feels so calming, that in this world of uncertainty, there is at least something that will accept me.)"
    mc "(But my head twinges in pain. My brain begins to contract and twist in my skull. It's so painful that I can't give up. Leaving it would be akin to torture.)"
    mc "(I force my body to get up from the bed. My arms cry out, but their pain is nothing compared to the ache that my head feels.)"
    mc "(I've gotten up from the bed. There's only one step left. I need to stand up and walk over to the nurse's office. My vision starts to sway and the dizziness returns. A TV-like static shocks my eyes.)"
    mc "(I can't tell if I need to move my legs up or down. I don't know if I can handle the pain any longer. I need to act now.)"
    mc "(I feel something inside my legs. Something primordial, something instinctual, something that if I forgot I would be so dearly regretful.)"
    mc "(I trust that feeling. I don't have anything else to go on. Not now, at least.)"
    mc "(My legs straighten up, forcing my torso up with it. My headache is unbearable. I'm going to collapse.)"
    mc "(But it stops. No pain, no static, no dizziness. It's gone in a matter of seconds. Almost like it never was there to begin with.)"
    mc "(My vision clears up. My arms relax. My brain is calm.)"
    mc "(I'm up.)"
    mc "(I've gotten a lot better at fine motor movements.)"
    mc "(I used to not even be able to pick up a pencil. Now, I can peel apples with my eyes closed.)"
    mc "(My other functions have improved as well, and as such, they moved me out of the ICU and into a regular hospital room.)"
    mc "(I'm quite sure I've made a full recovery, besides my memories, but the doctors want to keep me here until all of their concerns are gone.)"
    mc "(Now that I think about it, what am I going to do after I'm discharged?)"
    mc "(The nurse told me I was a college student before I got injured, but I don't think I can go back after missing so many classes.)"
    mc "(I'm still young, so I can't retire and spend the rest of my days in solitude.)"
    mc "(Hmmm…)"
    "*knock knock*"
    mc "(The nurse is here for his mid-day visit…)"
    "The door opens..."
    "Nurse" "Good afternoon!"
    mc "Hello."
    "Nurse" "How are you feeling today?"
    mc "Fine."
    "Nurse" "That's good."
    "Nurse" "Oh! You're being discharged today."
    mc "Really?"
    "Nurse" "Mmm. See, the thing is you don't have a home to go back to…"
    mc "(What?)"
    "Nurse" "And you also don't have the money to pay for the medical bills…"
    mc "(WHAT?)"
    mc "(He hands me a stapled list of papers containing all the expenses of my recovery.)"
    mc "(My eyes nearly water in disbelief. I hear my soul making a deafening shattering sound as I tally up the total.)"
    mc "Almost half a million…"
    mc "(This can't be real. Surely not?)"
    mc "(Unfortunately it is. Printed right at the bottom is a six-digit number: $457,860.65. Ambulance, medical supplies, surgeries, all merge forces to put me $458k in debt.)"
    "Nurse" "Yeah, it's a pretty impressive bill."
    "Nurse" "Fortunately for you, a kind man was willing to pay it off for you. However, he only did so on the condition that he could have a conversation with you before you left the hospital."
    mc "(Those words put a halt to my despairing mood in its tracks.)"
    mc "(All of it? What kind of millionaire is this guy? Why would he pay off some random person's medical bills?)"
    mc "(I don't think I'll be able to thank him properly, but if all he wants is a talk then I'll gladly respond.)"
    mc "I'll talk to him. Where do I meet him?"
    "Nurse" "Oh, he'll come in here shortly. In the meanwhile, you should probably prepare to leave soon."
    mc "(Prepare to leave? Didn't she say I don't have a home to go back to?)"
    mc "(But before I can ask, the nurse closes the door behind her and I'm once again left alone in the room. It doesn't help with the fact that hospital walls are so depressing.)"
    mc "(As I gather my thoughts, I look around the room for anything I'd like to take with me.)"
    mc "(Again, hospitals like to save money due to the expensive equipment. None of it is anything I can keep. I did borrow a few books from the library they have here, but only patients have the right to borrow them.)"
    mc "(Maybe I could ask for some of the coloring materials they give the children? They get used up every few weeks, so it's not like they're completely permanent. I don't need half-used crayons and colored pencils though, so I'd rather not do that.)"
    mc "(Before I can make a conclusive decision on what to steal from the hospital, the door swings open without so much as a knock.)"
    mc "(What a gentleman. Actually, I'm pretty sure this is the person who wanted to talk to me, so I shouldn't judge them before I get to know them.)"
    mc "(When I turn my head towards the door to try to greet my unknown savior, a powerful blast of cologne smacks into my face in the same manner as their door etiquette.)"
    mc "(This guy...)"
    mc "(As I recover from my involuntary trip down the Men's Beauty aisle, the loud clicking of dress shoes calmly approaches.)"
    mc "(A tall man steps through the door. He's dressed formally, with a matching black suit and pants, a pure white dress shirt, and a charcoal-colored tie that makes up the look of business formal.)"
    mc "(While some may call it professional, to me it just looks plain.)"
    mc "(That opinion doesn't apply when I get a good look at his face, however.)"
    mc "(Damn, he looks fine!)"
    mc "(This guy's got everything hasn't he, good looks, lots of money…)"
    mc "(Not that much now that I think about it. I shouldn't be too jealous of my mysterious hero.)"
    "He smirks"
    "Cool Man" "What, did I kick down the door too hard? Your eyes are blinking like a broken light."
    mc "(I quickly try to reassemble my expression into something worthy of conversation.)"
    mc "Sorry, you just surprised me."
    "Cool Man" "No worries. That happens to everyone on the first meeting."
    mc "(He steps closer to the bed and leans toward me.)"
    "Cool Man" "Hmm…"
    mc "(He's way too far into my personal space. I can feel his breath on my face.)"
    mc "Um, can I help you?"
    mc "(He seems to have realized how close he was.)"
    "Cool Man" "My bad, that's a bad habit of mine."
    mc "(Not bad enough to make him back off from me though.)"
    mc "(He continues to analyze me like a shark circling its prey. His aggressive eyes stare me down, missing not even a single hair on my body.)"
    mc "(Every fold of my skin, every pattern in my movements, every slight twitch of a muscle. Nothing seems to escape his sight.)"
    mc "(Finally, he leans back up and pats me on the head.)"
    "Cool Man" "Better than I expected. Certainly worth half a million."
    "Cool Man" "I'm sure you're quite confused right now. Don't worry. It'll all make sense soon."
    "Cool Man" "I work for a certain section of the government called the Disease Eradication Unit. As the name suggests, our job includes the extermination of diseases and the various cleanups relating to them."
    "Cool Man" "But dealing with diseases is a difficult job. People go missing, die, get PTSD, and worse. We have trouble finding backup employees should any one of these tragedies happen to one of our main employees."
    "Cool Man" "That's where you come in. You don't have a home to return to, or family and friends to care for if you go missing. I won't sugarcoat this. You will be a disposable pawn to the higher-ups."
    "Cool Man" "You'll do most of the work, but get the least of the benefits. It's not a very good position to be in."
    "Cool Man" "But don't worry. The benefits you will get are pretty good if I do say so myself."
    "Cool Man" "You get a free apartment, with gas and water all paid for. You get a pretty decent paycheck, and also the experience of a proper work environment with lots of friendly co-workers."
    "Cool Man" "What do you say?"
